# Favicon Instructions

## How to Add the Reddy Hotels Logo/Favicon

1. **Download the logo** from the original website (https://reddyhotel.com/)
   - The red "R" logo should be saved

2. **Create favicon files:**
   - `favicon.ico` (32x32 or 16x16)
   - `logo192.png` (192x192 for mobile)
   - `logo512.png` (512x512 for mobile)

3. **Place files in** `/public/` directory:
   ```
   /public/
     - favicon.ico
     - logo192.png
     - logo512.png
   ```

## Current Logo Design

The logo is a red "R" symbol as seen on the original website. The color appears to be:
- Red: #DC2626 (or similar red shade)

The logo has been recreated as SVG in the Navigation component for now, but you should replace the favicon files with the actual logo from reddyhotel.com.
